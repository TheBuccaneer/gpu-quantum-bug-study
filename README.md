# GPU-Accelerated Quantum Bug Analysis

This repository contains the dataset and analysis scripts for an empirical study of bugs in **GPU-accelerated quantum stacks** (e.g., **NVIDIA/cuda-quantum** and **Qiskit/qiskit-aer**).  
We code issues along a small taxonomy (e.g., stack layer / bug type / **CTClass A–C**) and generate the paper figures.

## Folders

- `data/` – raw and processed CSVs used for the analysis
- `scripts/` – analysis + figure generation scripts
- `figures/` – exported publication-ready figures (PDF/PNG)
- `doc/` – short concept/codebook and usage notes
